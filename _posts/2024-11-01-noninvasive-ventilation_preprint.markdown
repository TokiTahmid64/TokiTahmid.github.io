excerpt: "Respiratory failure is a critical condition that often requires mechanical ventilation to support or restore normal breathing. While invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is commonly used for severe cases, noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) offers a less intrusive alternative that reduces complications and can be applied in moderate cases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the global shortage of ventilators, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited access to life-saving equipment exacerbated the crisis. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a simplified, compartmental-based simulation model for NIMV. This model provides a practical and accessible tool for simulating respiratory system behavior under various ventilation modes, using the analogy between electrical circuits and lung physiology. By simulating key parameters such as airway resistance and lung compliance, the model allows clinicians and researchers to evaluate ventilator performance and optimize treatment strategies. Furthermore, the simulation offers a blueprint for developing cost-effective, easy- to-use NIMV systems that can be deployed in resource-constrained environments. Our contribution seeks to address the ventilator shortage by enabling better design and understanding of noninvasive ventilation, ultimately improving respiratory care for patients with moderate respiratory failure.
