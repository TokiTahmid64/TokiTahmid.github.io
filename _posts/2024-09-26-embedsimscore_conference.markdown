excerpt: "Accurately computing protein similarity is challenging due to the intricate interplay between local substructures and the global structure within protein molecules. Traditional metrics like TM-score often focus on aligning the global structures of the proteins in a rather geometry-based algorithmic way, potentially overlooking critical local global relations and contextual comparisons. We introduce Embed-SimScore, a novel self-supervised method that generates structural and contextual embeddings by jointly considering both local substructures and global proteins's structures. Utilizing contrastive language-structure pre training (CLSP) and structural contrastive learning, EmbedSimScore captures comprehensive features across different scales of protein structure. These embeddings provide a more precise and holistic means of computing protein similarities, resulting in the identification of intrinsic relations among proteins that traditional approaches overlook.
