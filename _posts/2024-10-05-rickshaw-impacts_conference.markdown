excerpt: "The changing climate is anticipated to result in more frequent and
extended heat waves having catastrophic effects on urban areas.
Prolonged exposure to extreme heat is believed to adversely affect
both physiological and psychological well-being, particularly for
outdoor workers. This study analyzed the effects of hot weather
conditions on the brainwaves of rickshaw pullers by examining changes in EEG signals before and after driving rickshaws at dif-
ferent air temperatures and relative humidity levels. We selected six rickshaw pullers as participants for six levels of air temperature
(Â°C) and humidity condition (%) in various outdoor areas in Dhaka
city, Bangladesh, while driving rickshaws for a duration of 20 to 30
minutes. The acquired EEG data assists in assessing the effects of
heat exposure on cerebral activity. Our statistical analysis shows
that there is a positive association between heat stress and the alpha
band power of brainwaves."
