excerpt: "Existing computational methods for the prediction of RNA related interactions often rely heavily on manually crafted features. Language model features for bio-sequences has gain significant popularity in proteomics and genomics. However, during interaction prediction, how language model features from different modalities should be combined to extract the most representative features is yet to be explored. We introduce BioLLMNet, a novel framework that introduces an effective combination approach for multi-modal bio-sequences. BioLLMNet provides a way to transform feature space of different moleculeâ€™s language model features and uses learnable gating mechanism to effectively fuse features. Rigorous evaluations show that BioLLMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in RNA-protein, RNA-small molecule, and RNA-RNA interactions, outperforming existing methods in RNA-associated interaction prediction.
